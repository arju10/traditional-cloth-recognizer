# 2. Data Collection, Model Training, Data Cleaning (done)
**Data Collection:** Downloaded from DuckDuckGo using term name <br/>
**DataLoader:** Used fastai DataBlock API to set up the DataLoader. <br/>
**Data Augmentation:** fastai provides default data augmentation which operates in GPU. <br/>


# Training and Data Cleaning
**Training:** Fine-tuned a resnet34 model for 6 epochs (3 times) and got upto ~70% accuracy. <br/>
**Data Cleaning:** This part took the highest time. Since I collected data from browser, there were many noises. Also, there were images that contained. I cleaned and updated data using fastai ImageClassifierCleaner. I cleaned the data each time after training or fine-tuning, except for the last time which was the final iteration of the model. <br/>

# 3. Deploy Model with Gradio & HuggingFace Spaces (done)
I deployed to model to HuggingFace Spaces Gradio App. The implementation can be found in `deployment` folder or [here](https://huggingface.co/spaces/msideadman/cap-recognizer).

# 4. Build a GitHub Pages Website and integrate API (done)
The deployed model API is integrated [here](https://arju10.github.io/tradiotional-cloth-recognizer/) in GitHub Pages Website. Implementation and other details can be found in `docs` folder.


# 5. Setting Up the project in GitHub  (done)
